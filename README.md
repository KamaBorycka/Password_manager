# Password manager

Password manager was designed to make it easier for users to create and remember strong, unique passwords for different accounts without having to use the multiple times, which can increase the risk of hacking. 

Name of the website/application, e-mail adress and password are saving on user's computer in `data.txt`.

In order to run this code, run `python3 main.py`.
